# simple_timer
 A quick and easy timer. One exe file, one data input, one beep. 



The Simple Timer is a quick and easy timer. It has only 1 point of data input where you set the duration of the timer. The Simple Timer can parse mathematical expressions, so you can readily input an hour as 60*60. During operation, the timer displays the seconds remaining. It beeps after the time has elapsed!
