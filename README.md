A quick and easy timer. One exe file, one data input, one beep. 

The Simple Timer is a quick and easy timer. It has only 1 point of data input where you set the duration of the timer. The Simple Timer can parse mathematical expressions, so you can readily input an hour as 60*60. During operation, the timer displays the seconds remaining. It beeps after the time has elapsed!

On Windows, download the exe file and you are done. On Linux/Mac, you need to compile using Lazarus.
